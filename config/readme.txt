This folder is reserved for X3 user config settings. Do not attempt to edit anything in this folder manually.


config.user.json
----------------
This file gets created once you edit settings from the X3 panel. It only stores differences from the default X3 configuration, and does not get overwritten when you upgrade X3.


protect.php
----------------
This file gets created once you add page/folder passwords from the X3 panel.


.htaccess
----------------
To protect your custom config, which includes panel login, mail settings and folder passwords, it is important that the .htaccess file is included in the root of this folder.
